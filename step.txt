Module Fusion: Stop after all supported layer sequences are fused.
QConfig Assignment: Stop when the model’s qconfig is set appropriately.
Preparation: Stop after observers are inserted.
Calibration: Stop once enough representative data has been run through the model to capture robust activation statistics.
Conversion: Stop after successfully converting the model to its quantized version.
Validation: Stop the process if the quantized model’s accuracy and performance are acceptable for your application.
Export: Stop when the model is exported and ready for the FPGA-specific toolchain.
